# Layout Paragraphs

Heavily under development.

@todo:

 - Set up schema for layout paragraph data
 - Can all layouts start out with a pre-named default content region that
   can't be removed? This can be the fallback/refuge region, and could be
   displayed slightly differently than the rest.
 - Save/load selected layout template and block data
 - Paragraph blocks with permissions, access for various types of Paragraphs
 - Display paragraphs in preview mode on layout in admin mode
 - Don't show "skip link" on keyboard navigation of layout paragraphs (e.g. on
   node edit page)
